# Getting Started with nDPI for Network Analysis

nDPI (Network Deep Packet Inspection) is a powerful open-source library for analyzing network traffic and detecting protocols in real-time. Whether you're building a network monitoring tool, implementing security analysis, or conducting research, nDPI provides the foundation you need.

## Why Choose nDPI?

nDPI stands out in the network analysis space for several reasons:

- **Comprehensive Protocol Support**: Detects 400+ protocols including modern applications
- **Security-Focused**: Built-in risk assessment and threat detection
- **High Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput environments
- **Open Source**: LGPL v3 license with active community support
- **Production Ready**: Used by ntopng, pfSense, and other commercial products

## Quick Start Example

Here's a simple example that shows how easy it is to get started with nDPI:

```c
#include <ndpi_api.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize nDPI
    struct ndpi_detection_module_struct* ndpi_mod = ndpi_init_detection_module(NULL);
    if (!ndpi_mod) {
        printf("Failed to initialize nDPI\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Finalize initialization
    ndpi_finalize_initialization(ndpi_mod);

    printf("nDPI %s initialized successfully!\n", ndpi_revision());
    printf("Ready to analyze network traffic\n");

    // Cleanup
    ndpi_exit_detection_module(ndpi_mod);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:
```bash
gcc -o ndpi_hello hello.c -lndpi
./ndpi_hello
```

## Real-World Application: PCAP Analysis

Let's look at a practical example that analyzes a PCAP file:

```c
#include <ndpi_api.h>
#include <pcap.h>

void analyze_pcap(const char* filename) {
    // Initialize nDPI
    struct ndpi_detection_module_struct* ndpi_mod = ndpi_init_detection_module(NULL);
    ndpi_finalize_initialization(ndpi_mod);

    // Open PCAP file
    char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
    pcap_t* handle = pcap_open_offline(filename, errbuf);
    if (!handle) {
        printf("Error opening PCAP: %s\n", errbuf);
        return;
    }

    printf("Analyzing %s...\n", filename);

    struct pcap_pkthdr* header;
    const u_char* packet;
    int packet_count = 0;

    // Process packets
    while (pcap_next_ex(handle, &header, &packet) == 1) {
        packet_count++;

        // Here you would extract flow information and call
        // ndpi_detection_process_packet() for each flow

        if (packet_count % 1000 == 0) {
            printf("Processed %d packets...\n", packet_count);
        }
    }

    printf("Analysis complete: %d packets processed\n", packet_count);

    pcap_close(handle);
    ndpi_exit_detection_module(ndpi_mod);
}
```

## Key Concepts to Master

### 1. Flow-Based Analysis
nDPI works with **flows** - sequences of packets between two endpoints. Understanding flow lifecycle is crucial:

- **Flow Creation**: When the first packet of a new connection is seen
- **Protocol Detection**: Analyzing multiple packets to identify the protocol
- **Flow Termination**: When connection ends or times out

### 2. Risk Assessment
Modern network analysis isn't just about protocol detection - it's about security:

```c
// Check for security risks
ndpi_risk_enum risks = ndpi_get_flow_risk(flow);
if (risks != NDPI_NO_RISK) {
    if (ndpi_isset_risk(flow, NDPI_MALICIOUS_JA3)) {
        printf("‚ö†Ô∏è Malicious TLS fingerprint detected!\n");
    }
    if (ndpi_isset_risk(flow, NDPI_URL_POSSIBLE_SQL_INJECTION)) {
        printf("‚ö†Ô∏è Possible SQL injection attempt!\n");
    }
}
```

### 3. Protocol Categories
nDPI doesn't just tell you "this is HTTP" - it provides rich context:

```c
struct ndpi_proto result = ndpi_detection_process_packet(/* ... */);
if (ndpi_is_protocol_detected(result)) {
    printf("Protocol: %s\n",
           ndpi_get_proto_name(ndpi_mod, result.proto.app_protocol));
    printf("Category: %s\n",
           ndpi_category_get_name(ndpi_mod, result.category));
}
```

## Building Your First Network Monitor

Here's the structure for a basic network monitoring application:

1. **Initialize nDPI** - Set up the detection engine
2. **Capture Packets** - Use libpcap or raw sockets
3. **Manage Flows** - Track connections and their state
4. **Analyze Protocols** - Feed packets to nDPI for analysis
5. **Handle Results** - Process detection results and risks
6. **Report/Store** - Output results to logs, databases, or dashboards

## Performance Considerations

When building production systems with nDPI:

- **Memory Management**: Properly free flows and detection modules
- **Flow Timeouts**: Implement flow cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Threading**: Use multiple threads for high-throughput scenarios
- **Packet Sampling**: Consider sampling for very high-speed networks
